# COVID-19 Time Series Analysis and ARIMA Prediction

## Overview
This repository focuses on the analysis of COVID-19 time series data, specifically the confirmed cases, recovered individuals, and reported deaths. The analysis is followed by the implementation of ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models for predicting future trends in each of the mentioned categories.

## Repository Contents

1. **Data Analysis:**
   - Explore the time series data of COVID-19, including confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths.
   - Visualize trends, patterns, and seasonality in the data.

2. **ARIMA Prediction:**
   - Apply ARIMA modeling for time series prediction.
   - Generate forecasts for the future time points of confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths.

## Instructions

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Ensure you have the COVID-19 time series data in the required format.
   - Adjust file paths or download the data using provided links in the analysis script.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - Run the data analysis script to visualize and understand the patterns in the COVID-19 time series data.

3. **ARIMA Prediction:**
